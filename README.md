## Clarifications

Clarifications for task 3:
I understood the logic of the required task and tried to act on it: a call to receive the dates of the upcoming deliveries, and with the received data do a FETCH to retrieve the details of deliveries on the received dates.
The renderer doesn't work well in my opinion, and it renders a large number of times, I haven't been able to handle the problem yet, so I'm uploading a project as it is:
The functions are ready, the component is complete, but there isprobably some problem with the synchronization...
The view that is currently received is not the view that I aimed for ðŸ«¢ðŸ˜¥.
I hope you get it...



Clarifications for task 4:
I started doing the task and didn't have time to finish....
